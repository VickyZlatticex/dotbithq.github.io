What is the principle of anti-squatting?</h3><p>On the blockchain, all operations of a user are public and transparent. Therefore, when a user wants to register a certain .bit account and the corresponding transaction is still in the memory pool and not packed into the block, other people are able to see what account that user wants to register. Others can immediately issue a transaction with a higher network fee in an attempt to get miners to package the transaction first to grab the account. Then sell the account at a higher price to someone who really wants to sign up for it. Preventing robocalls is about preventing this behavior as much as possible.</p><p>The .bit contract requires a two-step process for registering a new account, corresponding to two transactions, in order to prevent any squatting behavior.</p><ol><li><strong>Apply for registration in private</strong>: Hash the account to be registered with the registrant&#39;s public key, send the first transaction, and place this hash on the blockchain</li><li><strong>Reveal the account name on the chain</strong>: Initiate a registration request, exposing the account name to be registered and carrying the hash from the previous step, while the contract requires the hash to reach a mature state, i.e. the last transaction has been packed into the block and reached a certain number of confirmations.</li></ol><p>The two transactions need to be spaced, and the second transaction needs to include the Cell created by the first transaction. In addition, the user only discloses the plaintext of the account they want to register in the second step. By the time a malicious Keeper or miner sees the plaintext, it&#39;s too late. He has to start with the first transaction, and by the time he&#39;s ready, other Keepers have already registered the account for the user.</p><h3 id="why-does-the-interface-show-that-i-have-finished-the-anti-squatting-step-but-the-bit-account-i-want-to-register-is-taken-by-someone-else" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-the-interface-show-that-i-have-finished-the-anti-squatting-step-but-the-bit-account-i-want-to-register-is-taken-by-someone-else" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why does the interface show that I have finished the anti-squatting step but the .bit account I want to register is taken by someone else?</h3><p>It could happen when you and someone else is trying to register a same .bit account at the same time.
